List and proble OpenCL devices (compute devices and GPUs) from the command line. Both OpenCL framework and GPU OpenCL dirvers must be installed.

# Under development
There is no released version for this tool, it will be similar to the existing `clinfo` (or maybe `cldemo`) tools.

# Building
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .	# usually make -j8 works too
